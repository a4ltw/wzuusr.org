## Impact Stories

### Love Spreads in Cambodia

> "Despite unstable internet and platform limitations, online English teaching from Taiwan to Cambodia is extremely challenging. Wenzao international English volunteers used various gestures, sounds, expressions, and simple online interactive activities to help Cambodian elementary students with zero English quickly engage. They not only responded in simple English but also transformed from unfamiliar to familiar, from shy to confident."

> — Volunteer Reflection

### Service-Learning Win-Win Strategy

> "After the COVID-19 outbreak halted volunteer services, the team came to E-DA Hospital for the first time to discuss restarting professional volunteer services. E-DA Hospital and Wenzao reflected on and discussed past interpretation volunteer services. Interpretation volunteer Hung Ting-Lien also provided suggestions from her on-site experience for future improvements."
